# Capstone (I)

Completed: Spring 2024
Grade: A

## Course Description

During their last two semesters, senior Computer Science students form teams to
develop significant software projects. This class is the first semester in the
sequence. Seniors will work on team formation, project identification, project
planning (including UI design, software architecture, testing methods,
scheduling, etc.), and completion of a system prototype. This course will
provide teams with time and guidance to effectively plan their projects, as well
as emphasizing the written and oral communications necessary to succeed in
industry. Projects formed in this course must be completed during the following
semester in CS 4500. Students should have four or less CS electives/required
courses left when signing up for this course and should be graduating during the
following semester.

## Reflection

This first semester of capstone was focused mainly on deciding on a project idea
and building a team. I was able to find a backend heavy project amoung a sea of
nodejs web apps and social media mobile apps. The semester culminated in a
proof-of-concept project prototype that makes me hopeful for the next semester
of capstone.
