## About

This project is essentially a lite version of excel that is written in C# using
MAUI for the GUI.

## Features

Has all the basic features of excel. That included a display of cells (in our
case A-Z & 1-99) that can have their contents edited. The spreadsheet has
support for cells to store text, numbers, or formulas. Formulas are evaluated in
infix notation with the ability to reference other cells using the form of one
letter (case doesn't matter) followed by 1-2 digits with the first digit being
limited to 1-9.

## About Using the Spreadsheet

(Can also be found in the help menu in application)

### Saving and Loading Files

- To save and load files, as well as make a new spreadsheet please view the file
  menu.
- The save menu requires a complete file path with the file name and extension.
  For Example: C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\test.sprd
- Please use the .sprd file extension for all files you save and load.
- The open file menu will only work with valid .sprd files.
- Selecting new/open before saving a spreadsheet will prompt you to save your
  work to prevent unintentional loss of data.

### Using the Spreadsheet

- A cell may contain either a number, text, or a formula.
- All formulas must start with = (i.e. '=A1' would be a formula that is just the
  value of cell A1).
- Cell names are not case sensitive. IE A1 = a1.
- When making formulas it is possible to set invalid values. These can take the
  form of either errors or exceptions. Errors are for formulas that are valid
  but the cell values that they use are not. They will result in the value of a
  cell displaying ERROR. Exceptions mean that it is an invalid formula and will
  result in a message being displayed in the Display Bar as well as not updating
  the contents.
- Cells have a 10 char limit to their displays. If you exceed this limit the
  display will be truncated. However, The original value is still held and used
  for formula purposes.

### Display Bar

- The display bar has 4 sections. The Name, Value, Content, and Error sections.
- The Name section displays the name of the cell you currently have selected.
- The Value section displays what will be displayed in the actual spreadsheet
  cell.
- The Content section is what you will edit and hold the unevaluated form of the
  Value section.
- The Error section is hidden by default, but will display messages related to
  content exceptions.

### Navigation

- You navigate the spreadsheet with your mouse.
- Click on a cell to select it.
- On the Display Bar (tm) you can edit the cells contents in the entry.
- You may use the enter button or the enter key on your keyboard to update
  values.
- The menu bar at the top of the page contains file and help options.
- You may scroll vertically and horizontally on the spreadsheet.

## Additional Features

One of the requirements for this assignment was to add additional feature(s) not
required by the rubric. This section is for TA reference to see what my
additional features are:

### Truncation of Values

Normally since cells don't resize themselves if you were to input a very long
string or number the value would flow out of its cell and overlap with the next
one. This is an issue that I have fixed by causing my spreadsheet to truncate
the values that are displayed in the cells. This does not actually effect the
backing content of value of the cell only what is displayed on the screen. It
works by calling a truncate method whenever it detects the string to be
displayed to be longer that 10 characters in length. If the original value was a
number it then converts this number into scientific notation with a precision of
3 decimal places. If the original value was a string it displays the first 10
characters of the string followed by "..." to let the user know that not the
whole value is being displayed.

### Dark Mode

In almost any application that is being used today they offer a "Dark Mode" that
allows the user to swap the UI color palette for one that is less taxing on the
eyes. I have added that functionality through the use of a drop down menu. The
dark mode toggle can be found right next to the help and file menus. It works by
changing the colors that the backing SpreadsheetGrid uses to draw itself.

## Short-comings

This spreadsheet is essentially fully functional, however there are still some
little annoyances that exist. These include the fact that I was unable to get
the content entry box to auto-select itself when selecting a new cell. This
means that you have to click on the new cell and then move your mouse all the
way to the top of the window in order to select the entry box to update the
content. Another annoyance is the fact that navigation is only possible with the
mouse. I wanted to implement keyboard only navigation, but with the first issue
that became impossible. There is also the fact that I would have to use another
library to deal with key input events, which would not be allowed for this
assignment.
