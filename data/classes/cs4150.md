# Algorithms

Completed: Spring 2024
Grade: B+

## Course Description

Study of algorithms, data structures, and complexity analysis beyond the
introductory treatment from CS 2420. Balanced trees, heaps, hash tables, string
matching, graph algorithms, external sorting and searching. Dynamic programming,
exhaustive search. Space and time complexity, derivation and solution of
recurrence relations, complexity hierarchies, reducibility, NP completeness.
Laboratory practice.

## Reflection

This class was your bog-standard algorithms class. It focused on time and space
complexity with an emphasis on solving problems in sub-exponential time. We
learned the main classes of algorithms that exist as well as discussed the kinds
of problems that would be best suited for each algorithmic approach. While this
is not the kind of material I tend to enjoy the class was informative and I can
understand why it is a required course for the BCS undergrad. Despite the course
being very homework heavy seeing upwards of 6 assignments per week, it still
felt manageable and encouraged problem-solving rather than just giving you the
algorithms it expected you to use.
