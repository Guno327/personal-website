# Software Practice I

Completed: Fall 2022 Grade: A-

## Course Description

Practical exposure to the process of creating large software systems, including
requirements specifications, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.
Emphasis on software process, software tools (debuggers, profilers, source code
repositories, test harnesses), software engineering techniques (time management,
code, and documentation standards, source code management, object-oriented
analysis and design), and team development practice. Much of the work will be in
groups and will involve modifying preexisting software systems.

## Reflection

This class was the 3rd major programming class I took in my degree. It was my
first foray into languages other than Java, C#. This class was more of a sequel
to CS1420 than it was a continuation of the work done in CS2420. It focuses on
the idea of producing packages of code deemed software and saw a large project
that took up the majority of the semesters workload. This class allowed me to
hone my programming skills and become comfortable with the common idea that
"Once you know one programming language you know them all."
