## Assignment Description

The objective of this assignment it to implement a simulator for a simplified
x86 processor. The basic job of a simulator is to mimic a real processor by
keeping track (in software) of the various components of a processor such as
registers, memory, and which instruction to execute next. As your simulator
program runs, it should "execute" simulated x86 instructions one at a time,
while updating software representations of registers and memory.
