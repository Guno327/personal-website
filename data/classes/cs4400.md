## Reflection

I made a joke in my CS2420 reflection that I wrote the most code line-for-line
in that class, well I spent the most time hour-for-hour programming in this
class. With the course jumping straight into the deep end with x86 assembly and
my first time coding in C it truley was an experience. I would consider this
course a spiritual successor to CS3810 in that it continued the focus on
hardware and building low level systems to integrate with said hardware. This
was also the first course where textbook study was REQUIRED for success. The
multitude of complex topics that require a detailed understanding of to
implement correctly were countless. As a Linux entusiast I thourougly enjoyed
this course and would dare to call it one of my favorites.
