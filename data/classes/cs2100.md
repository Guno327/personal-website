# Discreete Structures

Completed: Fall 2022\
Grade: A

## Course Description

Introduction to propositional logic, predicate logic, formal logical arguments,
finite sets, functions, relations, inductive proofs, recurrence relations,
graphs, probability, and their applications to Computer Science.

## Reflection

This course is a math course thinly veiled as a CS course. It takes the
mathematical concept of discrete structures and applies it to the computer
science field. Despite that fact I thorougly enjoyed this course (and have
currently TAed 2 semester of this course Fall23 and Spring24). This course
focuses on logic, combinatorics and probability, graphs, and proofs. It teaches
you how to think like a computer scientists and apply a logical, mathematical
approach to problem solving. Its deep dive into graphs and sets also provided
much needed insight into visiualizing data at this point in my degree. This
truley was the begining of the so-called theory classes. Due to this there was
no actual programming/projects in this course.
