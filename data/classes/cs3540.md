# Designing Human Centered Experiences

Completed: Fall 2023\
Grade: A

## Course Description

In this course, students learn how to identify human needs and goals that
technologies might address. Next, students learn to iteratively design
technologies that support those goals and promote positive user experiences.
Students identify user needs, frame problems, brainstorm solutions, design
low-fidelity prototypes, evaluate usability, and communicate the reasoning
behind a design. The centerpiece of the course is a semester-long group project
in which students learn and apply principles of user-centered design. This
course does not focus on implementation and typically does not include any
programming.

## Reflection

I dub this class "arts and crafts for CS Majors." This is due to the fact that a
large portion of this class focuses on the prototyping process and the idea that
it is important to make the right thing than to make a thing right. This idea
was at the forefront of all of the exercises we did. However, near the end of
the class it got a bit too focused on the idea that we as an industry really
need to put handicapped users higher on our todo list when programming
applicaitons. While a valid argument I felt it was a strange tangent from the
other concepts in the course.
