# About

My name is Gunnar and I am a recent graduate from the University of Utah with a
BCS in Computer Science. I am a backend engineer with a focus on systems
programming. I have an appreciation for the theoretical side of computing thanks
to my time teaching in theory focused Computer Sciences courses during my
undergraduate career.

Despite my focus being systems programming, I have a healthy breadth of
experience in many disciplines. Thanks to my focus on computational theory I am
able to get up to speed with new frameworks/languages quickly.
