## Reflection

Where do I even start. This was my favorite course of my entire undergraduate
career. There were no exams and 90% of the grade was focused on the semester
long project of building a compiler from scratch. The language we were to build
a compiler for was well documented in an official, production manner. This
allowed us to get a feel for what it might be like to build a compiler from a
language spec in our future careers. We were given the freedom to code in
whatever language we chose and approach each problem how we saw fit, as long as
our compiler passed the fuzzer tests. This was the one downside of this course.
All of the grading was done through GitHub Actions fuzzer tests, meaning that
they were only looking at the diff of your compilers output with the expected.
This meant that you could generate functional output, yet fail the tests. The
worst part of this was that the reference compiler was often incorrect meaning
you had to take you working compiler and break it in order to pass all of the
tests.
