# Engineering Probability and Statistics

Completed: Fall 2022
Grade: A-

## Course Description

An introduction to probability theory and statistics, with an emphasis on
solving problems in electrical and computer engineering. Topics in probability
include discrete and continuous random variables, probability distributions,
sums and functions of random variables, the law of large numbers, and the
central limit theorem. Topics in statistics include sample mean and variance,
estimating distributions, correlation, regression, and hypothesis testing.
Engineering applications include failure analysis, process control,
communication systems, and speech recognition. (Cross-listed as ECE3530)

## Reflection

I took this at the same time as CS2100 and this course followed the idea of
being a math course disguised as a CS course. It took part of what was learned
in CS2100 (combinatorics and probabilty) and exapanded on those. Since I took AP
Stats in high school this course was nothing new to me and seemed more
applicable to those interested in exclusivley data science as a way to get your
feet wet with analayzing large sets of data in a meaningful way. Once again no
projects due to the theoretical approach this class took.
