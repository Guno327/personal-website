# Capstone (II)

Completed: Fall 2025
Grade: A

## Course Description

This course is the capstone experience for graduating Computer Science seniors.
It involves the development of significant software systems by small,
self-selected student teams, with emphasis on applying sound, disciplined
software engineering practice. Projects are defined and selected at the
beginning of the semester, after which progress is demonstrated through
documentation, meetings, and demos. The class culminates in a Demo Day at which
students present their projects to faculty, students and project sponsors.

## Reflection

Despite Capstone I getting the team off to a great start, this semester is where
cracks started to form. The issue was not with the team but with the instruciton
staff. Despite the advertising that this semester would be "all about the code"
we had tons of busy work. Everything from weekly standups with the course staff
where it became apparent that they were not keeping up with your projects
development process and gave low-effort pedantic comments such as "I do not like
this font" or "Make sure you are updating your weekly progress board." It often
felt that the course staff was getting in the way of our project. Despite that
fact my team was able to deliver on all of our promises outlined in the design
document and produce a product we are truly proud of.
