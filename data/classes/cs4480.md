# Computer Networks

Completed: Spring 2025\
Grade: A

## Course Description

A comprehensive study of the principles and practices of data communication and
networks. Topics include transmission media, data encoding, local and wide area
networking architectures, internetwork and transport protocols (e.g., IPv4,
IPv6, TCP, UDP, RPC, SMTP), networking infrastructure (e.g., routers,
nameservers, gateways), network management, distributed applications, network
security, and electronic commerce. Principles are put into practice via a number
of programming projects. Undergraduate Students only.

## Reflection

I wish that I could have given this course more time, but as I was taking it
along side CS4470 - Compilers, that stole most of my focus. Despite that fact
this class saw 3 major projects that were applicable to real world networking
applications and quite intensive. While the projects where fun, this course had
mandatory weekly quizzes and exams that seemed pedantic and disjoint from the
material covered in the projects.
