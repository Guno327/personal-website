### Introduction to Computer Graphics

Completed: Fall 2023 Grade: A

## Course Description

Computer graphics is the discipline of generating images though computer
programs. This course covers modern computer graphics hardware and software.
Students will learn raster algorithms in 2D and 3D, coordinate transformation,
projections, projections, lighting/shading, and texture mapping, vertex and
fragment shaders and how they work. Students will also learn the differences
between raster algorithms and ray-tracing algorithms.

## Reflection

This course was unlike anything I had done in my degree up until this point. I
showed up to the first lecture where the professor said "We will be using WebGL
and JavaScript. If you don't know them I suggest you learn soon" and learn I
did. The course was more focused on the theory behind computer graphics than the
actual implementation. That is not to say we did not implement anything (we did
plenty of that), but the lectures focused on the math and theory behind the
implementation and left us to fill in the blanks. This course was both
frustrating at times, but incredibly satisfying. Most of my coding up until this
point had been CLI based or terrible UIs that I had designed (I never claimed to
be a Front-End dev). Being able to see beautiful objects rendered because of my
work was great.
