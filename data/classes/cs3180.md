# Computer Orginization

Completed: Spring 2023\
Grade: A

## Course Description

An in-depth study of computer architecture and design, including topics such as
RISC and CISC instruction set architectures, CPU organizations, pipelining,
memory systems, input/output, and parallel machines. Emphasis is placed on
performance measures and compilation issues.

## Reflection

This course was an introduction to the low-level ideas that go along with
programming. The idea that all code boils down to machine code and that assembly
gives us a way to visualize machine instructions in a human readable format. It
stressed the importance of knowing what the machine is doing when it runs your
code in order to write better, faster code. The course focused on MIPS assembly
with the use of emulators to allow us to practice writing assembly by hands.
However, assembly was only part of the courses focus and it also saw discussion
of hardware design and concepts built upon that (eg. cache hierachy). For a
little while I felt like I might have accidently become a Computer Engineering
major! This class also sparked my love for low level programming .
