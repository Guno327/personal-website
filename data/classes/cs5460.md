## Reflection

Where to begin? This course was awesome. We dove deep into the underlying
structures that allow an operating system to function. From page tables to
interrupts we covered it all. During the semester we read lots of intel CPU
manuals as well as straight-up kernel code to allow us to gain an insight into
how one might go about implementing the abstract topics that we covered in
class. Along with this we slowly built our own tiny kernel that we got to boot
on physical hardware by the end of the semester. This class was challenging but
immensely interesting an rewarding.
