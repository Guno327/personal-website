## Assignment Description

In this assignment, you will practice with data structures and pointers in C++
by implementing a trie, a specialized tree structure that can have good
performance retrieving dictionary words. Your code will be evaluated not only
for a functional trie, but also best practices with making classes that manage
their own internal memory allocations.
