## Assignment Overview

You will develop an educational program to teach a specific topic.\
Specific Requirement

- You must use Qt and C++ (not QML Qt Quick elements).
- The educational program side:
  - There must be an educational goal to the program. The more specific the
    topic or knowledge the better.
  - The educational program must have a few levels or phases to work through (or
    something obvious that has progress that can be measured).
  - The educational program must make use of a physics engine. I will discuss
    Box2D. This may seem like overkill for many topics, but even something as
    simple as making buttons quiver or letters on a title screen bounce around
    adds visual interest and "life" to a project. It is probably a mistake to
    make a "learning physics app" based on this requirement.
